In the heart of the town is the vast Market Square (Rynek) and the thirteenth-century town hall, with its magnificently ornate facades. The hall is now the Town Museum (Wed–Sat 10am–5pm, Sun 10am–6pm; 20zł). In the northwest corner of the square are two curious Baroque houses known as Jaś i Małgosia (Hansel and Gretel), linked by a gateway giving access to St Elizabeth’s, the finest of Wrocław’s churches. Its ninety-metre tower (Mon–Sat 10am–7pm, Sun noon–7pm; 5zł) is the city’s most prominent landmark.
