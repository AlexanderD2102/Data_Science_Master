A half-day bus ride north of Rovaniemi, Inari lies along the fringes of Inarijärvi, one of Finland’s largest lakes, and makes an attractive base from which to explore this part of Lapland further. In the town, the excellent Siida (Sámi Museum; June–Sept daily 9am–7pm; Sept–May Tues–Sun 10am–5pm; €10) has an outstanding outdoor section illustrating how the Sámi survived in Arctic conditions in their tepees, or kota, while the indoor section has a well-laid-out exhibition on life in the Arctic. Huge photographs depict how drastically the weather fluctuates here throughout the year. Towards the northern end of the village, summer boat tours (€20) depart from under the bridge to the ancient Sámi holy site on the island of Ukonkivi. If walking’s your thing, then check out the pretty Pielpajärvi Wilderness Church, a well-signposted 7km (2hr) hike from the village. Hotel Inari (t 016 671 016) has an adjoining outdoor adventure company that organizes fun excursions in the surrounding wilderness.
