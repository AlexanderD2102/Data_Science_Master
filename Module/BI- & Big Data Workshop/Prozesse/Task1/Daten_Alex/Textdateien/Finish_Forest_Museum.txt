Punkaharju, a densely forested ridge set amid the lakes 35km southeast of Savonlinna, and accessible by train, is your best opportunity to get out into the region’s stunning countryside. A must-see near the train station is the Finnish Forest Museum (June–Aug daily 10am–7pm; May & Sept daily 10am–5pm; Oct–April Tues–Sun 10am–5pm; €10), which has riveting exhibits that bring the forests and their place in Finnish culture alive. There’s a restaurant, and trails nearby.
