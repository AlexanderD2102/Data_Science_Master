Palatul_Parlamentului;Romania;Europe;"Palatul Parlamentului Dominating the entire project from the western end of Bulevardul Unirii is the colossal Palatul Parlamentului (Palace of Parliament), claimed to be the second-largest administrative building in the world – after the Pentagon – measuring 270m by 240m, and 86m high. It epitomizes the megalomania that overtook Ceau?escu in the 1980s; here he intended to house ministries, Communist Party offices and the apartments of high functionaries. Built on the site of the former Spirei Hill, which was razed for this project, the sheer size of the building can only be grasped by comparison with the toy-like cars scuttling past below. It has twelve storeys, four underground levels (including a nuclear bunker), a 100m-long lobby and 1100 rooms, around half of which are used as offices while the remainder are redundant. The interiors are lavishly decorated with marble and gold leaf, and there are 4500 chandeliers (11,000 were planned), the largest of which weighs 1.5 tonnes, but the decoration was never finished due to the Ceau?escus’ ever-changing whims. They were demanding patrons, allowing little more than a technical role to the architects, of which there were around seven hundred – one staircase was rebuilt three times before they were satisfied.

This huge white elephant was officially known as the Casa Republicii, then as the Casa Poporului, but more popularly as the Casa Nebunului (Madman’s House), before taking on its present name. The new government spent a long time agonizing about an acceptable use for it, and in 1994 it was finally decided to house the Senate and Parliament here; it is now also used for international conferences.

There are several different tours available. The standard one is a 45-minute trek through ten of the most dazzling, most representative or simply the largest of the halls, such as the extraordinary, glass-ceilinged Sala Unirii (Unification Hall), where legendary Romanian gymnast Nadia Comaneci was married in 1996. One of the last chambers you’re led to is the Alexandru Ioan Cuza room, whose balcony offers defining views of the city. Other tours take in the basement, terrace or both. The palace is so popular (particularly with tour groups) that you’d do well to time your visit for the start or the end of the day.

Muzeul Na?ional de Art? Contemporan?
Located in the building’s west wing (to the rear of the palace) is the Muzeul Na?ional de Art? Contemporan? (National Museum of Contemporary Art). Accessed via a specially constructed glass annexe and external elevators (which, as they take you up, give you some idea of the breathtaking scale of this building), it’s a superbly designed space covering four floors. All the works on display are temporary (typically two- or three-month rotating programmes), featuring both Romanian and international artists, and mostly take the form of multimedia installations (including large-screen projections), sculptures, collages, montages and photographic displays."
Bucharest's_Old_Town;Romania;Europe;Bound by Pia?a Unirii to the south, Calea Victoriei to the west and Bulevardul I.C. Br?tianu to the east, the Old Town – an area more commonly known as Lipscani – was mercifully spared Ceau?escu’s bulldozers, and it now offers a welcome respite from the concrete monotony of the Centru Civic. The main thoroughfare is Strada Lipscani itself, a lively street named after the merchants from Leipzig who traded here in the eighteenth century. An otherwise picturesque and agreeably ramshackle maze of streets and decrepit houses, Bucharest’s oldest neighbourhood has been undergoing painfully slow regeneration for years, and while many parts of it remain desperately run-down, the sheer volume of restaurants, cafés and bars in the area makes it the place to party in town.
Romania's_Coast;Romania;Europe;"Romania’s Black Sea coast (the litoral) holds the promise of white beaches, dazzling water and an average of ten to twelve hours of sunshine a day between May and October. Under communism, over a million people flocked to the resorts during the season; visitor numbers subsequently halved but have since recovered, with far better conditions than previously. Travelling from Bucharest or the Delta, your first stop on the coast will almost certainly be Constan?a, a relaxed seaport-cum-riviera town, dotted with Turkish, Byzantine and Roman remains, which has always seemed to keep a discreet distance from the surrounding resorts.

Constan?a
Doi Mai
Jupiter and Venus
Mamaia
Neptun and Olimp
Vama Veche
North of Constan?a, Mamaia is indisputably the coastal hot spot, swarming with hotels and buzzing with nightlife, while the multiplicity of resorts to the south, merging imperceptibly with one another, are more uniform; their seasons are also much shorter. Mangalia is the only town of any real size south of Constan?a and the one place not dependent upon tourism, beyond which lie the twin resorts of Doi Mai and Vama Veche. Located just a few kilometres from the Bulgarian border, they offer a more relaxed vibe and a welcome escape from the crowds.

Constan?a
Most visitors first encounter the Black Sea coast at CONSTAN?A, a busy riviera town and Romania’s principal port. Its ancient precursor, Tomis, was supposedly founded by survivors of a battle with the Argonauts, following the capture of the Golden Fleece; centuries later, the great Roman poet Ovid was exiled here for nine years until his death in 17 AD. These days, the town is an attractive mix of Greco-Roman remains, Turkish mosques and crisp modern boulevards, home to several interesting museums and a lively restaurant scene.

The oldest area of Constan?a, centred on Pia?a Ovidiu, stands on a headland between what is now the tourist port and the huge area of the modern docks to the south and west. Walking up the shore from the tourist port, you’ll find Constan?a’s passable beach, and inland, beyond the remains of the walls of ancient Tomis, the modern commercial area, along boulevards Ferdinand and Tomis. Further north, nearing the resort of Mamaia, are various sights designed to appeal to children, including a dolphinarium. Pilot cutters mounted by the road at the town’s northern and southern entries attest to its status as a port, as does its biggest festival, Navy Day on August 15, when up to ten thousand people watch the parade.

Doi Mai
Ten kilometres south of Mangalia is the laidback village of Doi Mai (2 May), so named after Alexandru Ioan Cuza’s coup d’état on this day in 1864. Despite lying in the shadow of the massive yellow cranes of Mangalia’s shipyard, it’s a peaceful and relaxed little resort, and extremely popular with families, thanks to its small but neatly formed and well-kept beach, part of which is for nudists; there’s the odd low-key beach bar here too. The Doi Mai-Vama Veche Marine Reserve begins just south of the Mangalia port and extends to the border. Loggerhead turtles can be seen here, as well as sea horses, dolphins and corals.

Jupiter and Venus
The resorts to the south of Neptun are more uniform, less lively and likely to have fewer hotels open outside July and August. The first, immediately abutting Neptun, is JUPITER, between the forest and the artificial Lake Tismana, beyond which is a gently sloping beach with fine sand. Southeast of here is Aurora, set on the cape of the same name and dominated by several pyramidal hotel complexes. There’s a minimal gap before you hit VENUS – broadly similar to Jupiter, but quieter and more family-oriented; Venus also has the most appealing accommodation along this stretch of coast. To the south of Venus is a sulphurous spa and, just inland, the Herghelia Mangalia stables, where you can hire horses to explore the forest, inhabited by roe deer, grouse and pheasants.

Mamaia
MAMAIA, 6km north of Constan?a, is Romania’s best-known coastal resort, and the place where the majority of package tourists end up. Legend has it that the gods created the beach to reunite a kidnapped princess with her daughter, who was abandoned on the seashore wailing “Mamaia, Mamaia!”; its fine, almost white sand, fringed with wild pear trees, is the resort’s greatest asset, especially since its gentle gradient and the absence of currents and strong tides make it particularly safe for children.

As late as the 1930s, Mamaia was, in the words of Gregor von Rezzori, “an empty expanse, excepting two or three bathing huts and a wooden pier, of miles of golden sand and tiny pink shells”; a far cry from what you’ll find here today. Ranged along a narrow spit of land between the Black Sea and Lake Siutghiol, the resort’s main street curves away around the shore of the lake. The southern stretch of the beachfront promenade is dominated by fast-food stands, mini-markets, pharmacies and shops selling all manner of beach paraphernalia and other accessories, but, beyond the casino (which is more or less the heart of Mamaia), the resort is more restrained. The telegondola will whisk you the 2km from near the Aqua Magic park at the southern end of Mamaia to just north of the casino. There’s a big plaza on the inland side of the casino, with a small stage and rows of family restaurants (mostly pizza places, all with big terasas). Mamaia’s main summer festival is the (biannual) Sunwaves Festival, which is held alternately in May and mid-August and features a world class line-up of electronic acts performing across several stages on Kazeboo beach in the north of the resort.

Neptun and Olimp
Sixteen kilometres south of Eforie Nord, NEPTUN was built in 1960 between the Comorova forest and the sea, ensuring a lush setting for the artificial lakes and dispersed villas. Originally enclaves for the communist nomenklatura, today Neptun and its classier, but much quieter, satellite of OLIMP, just north, are patronized by relatively affluent Romanian families and some Western tourists.

Both resorts are strung out along Strada Trandafirilor; in Neptun, about halfway along near the main complex of shops, Aleea Steagurilor leads down between a couple of lakes to the beach, with waterslides, beach bars and restaurants, and paths leading around the lakes; to the north are both government-owned and private villas – from the path you can see albino peacocks in one garden.

Vama Veche
Under communism, VAMA VECHE (Old Customs Post), just short of the border with Bulgaria, was closed to all but staff of Cluj University or those who could claim some vague affiliation with it; it became a haven for artists, intellectuals and nonconformists looking for an escape from the surveillance of the Securitate. In recent years, locals and investors have begun to capitalize on Vama Veche’s countercultural reputation, and there’s now an attractive assortment of accommodation on offer, ranging from low-key hotels and offbeat hostels to wild camping on the beach. While tourist facilities here continue to grow at a steady pace, fortunately the new developments have been planned with consideration for their surroundings, and the town still retains an air of bohemian sophistication not found elsewhere on the coast. Vama Veche’s nightlife is also some of the best along the coast, with open-air dancing till dawn and live music in some great little bars on the beach, most wooden-walled and thatch-roofed. The beach itself is a long, wide expanse and tends to be more secluded the further south you go, while there’s an area for nudist bathing up towards the northern end. The centre of the village, such as it is, is Strada Ion Creang?, a busy and colourful little street leading down from the main road to the beachfront; here you’ll find most things of a practical nature, including an ATM and the village’s small supermarket.

The village’s main annual event, taking place during the last week of August, is Vama Under Oscar Lights, whose main focus is film and photography, with numerous exciting screenings and exhibitions, but there’s lots more besides, including painting workshops, theatrical performances and concerts; these mostly occur on or near the beach, and are free."
Delta_wildlife;Romania;Europe;"The Danube Delta is a paradise for wildlife, and after years of environmental neglect culminating in Ceau?escu’s plan to drain the Delta for agricultural use, it was declared a Biosphere Reserve in 1990, with over 500 square kilometres strictly protected, and a UNESCO World Heritage Site the following year. The reserve is also a member of DANUBEPARKS, a network of seventeen protected areas along the length of the Danube, which was formed in 2009.

The area is particularly important for birds, which pass through during the spring and autumn migrations, or come from Siberia to winter here or from Africa to breed in summer. Besides herons, glossy ibis, golden eagles, avocets, shelduck and other Mediterranean breeds, the Delta is visited by reed buntings, white-tailed eagles and various European songbirds, as well as whooper swans, arctic grebes and half-snipes from Siberia, saker falcons from Mongolia, and egrets, mute swans and mandarin ducks from China. Its lakes support Europe’s largest colonies of pelicans, which come from Africa to breed. The best time to see birds is from April to early June (the latter being the wettest month of the year), and September. Some 135 species of fish have also been catalogued in the Delta, with healthy stocks of carp and pike, as well as a resurgence in sturgeon; the best time to fish is September and October. The Delta is also home to otters, mink, boars, wolves and other animals, while at night streets in the Delta villages are alive with frogs, beetles and hawk moths."
Sibiu_and_around;Romania;Europe;"“I rubbed my eyes in amazement,” wrote Walter Starkie of SIBIU (Hermannstadt in German and Nagyszeben in Hungarian) in 1929. “The town where I found myself did not seem to be in Transylvania, for it had no Romanian or Hungarian characteristics: the narrow streets and old gabled houses made me think of Nuremberg.” Nowadays, the illusion is harder to sustain, in a city surrounded by high-rise suburbs and virtually abandoned by the Saxons themselves, but the Old Town’s brightly painted houses, with “eye” windows to ventilate their attic grain stores, are still startling. Sibiu has many fine old churches and some of Romania’s best museums, as well as the remains of the bastions and fortifications.

Cisn?die
The church and museums
The Saxons
Sibiu festivals
Founded by 1191, Sibiu was the Transylvanian Saxons’ chief city, dominating trade with Wallachia through the Olt gorge. In 1241 their citadel was destroyed by the Tatars, leaving only a hundred survivors; the townsfolk surrounded themselves by 1452, with four rings of walls, which repelled the Turks three times but were largely demolished in the nineteenth century. Now, the wheel has turned, and Sibiu has stronger trading links with Germany than any other Transylvanian town, and even elected a Saxon mayor – so successful that he was elected president in 2014. His greatest coup was Sibiu’s nomination as European Capital of Culture for 2007, which brought a million visitors to the city.

Cisn?die
CISN?DIE, 12km south of Sibu, was known to the Saxons as Heltau and to the Turks as the Red Town, both for the colour of its walls and the blood that was shed attempting to breach them. Pia?a Revolu?iei (more a long wide street than a square) leads to the largely Romanesque church.

The church and museums
A formidable bulk protected by a double wall (1460–1530) and a moat, Cisn?die’s church is still home to an active Lutheran congregation. You can ascend the massive thirteenth-century tower, climbing through lofty vaults linked by creaking ladders to the belfry. The view of red rooftops and angular courtyards is superb, with the tiny Romanesque church (dating from 1223) overlooking the village of Cisn?dioara just visible below the Cindrel mountains. The church grounds are the unlikely setting for a small Museum of Communism containing newspaper clippings, a calendar used for bread rationing, and objects belonging to former party members. Upstairs in the tower facing the church door is the new Museum of Ten Centuries, displaying a precious object from each century of the town’s history, such as a thirteenth-century processional cross, a fourteenth-century missal, a fifteenth-century chalice, a sixteenth-century Lutheran bible, and postcards sent home during World War I.

The Saxons
Southern Transylvania was the Saxon heartland, and the landscape is still marked by the vestiges of their culture. In 1143, King Géza II of Hungary invited Germans to colonize strategic regions of Transylvania, their name for which was Siebenbürgen, from their original “seven towns”, of which Hermannstadt (Sibiu to the Romanians) became the most powerful.

Around them, hundreds of villages developed a distinctive culture and vernacular style of architecture. Although the Székely, just north, put low walls about their churches and the Moldavians raised higher ones about their monasteries, it was the Saxons who perfected this type of building; their churches were initially strengthened to give refuge from raiding Tatars, with high walls and towers then added to resist the more militarily sophisticated Turks. Some also had warrens of storerooms to hold sufficient food to survive a siege.

Alas for the Saxons, their citadels were no protection against the tide of history, which steadily eroded their influence from the eighteenth century on and put them in a difficult position during World War II. Although many bitterly resented Hitler’s giving Northern Transylvania to Hungary in 1940, others embraced Nazism and joined the German army. As collective punishment after the war, all fit Saxon men between 17 and 45, and women between 18 and 30 (thirty thousand in all), were deported to the Soviet Union for between three and seven years of slave labour; many did not return, and those who did mostly found their property confiscated.

Most Saxons left the area for Germany after 1989, but most of their villages still have fortified churches and rows of houses presenting a solid wall to the street – hallmarks of their Saxon origins. They’re now largely populated by Romanians and Gypsies, but church restoration and cultural projects are gathering pace.

Sibiu festivals
Sibiu has one of Romania’s liveliest and most varied festival rosters. The best is the superb International Theatre Festival (w sibfest.ro), over ten days in early June – there are nightly performances (including music and contemporary dance) on an open-air stage on Pia?a Mare, plus a multitude of different events (installations, films, plays and art/photography exhibitions) elsewhere around town. There’s also a Jazz Festival at the beginning of May, the Cântece Mun?ilor “Songs of the Mountains” folklore festival in mid-August, the Potters’ Fair on the first weekend of September and, in mid-October, the excellent ASTRA International Festival of Documentary Film (w astrafilm.ro). Finally, CibinFest (w cibinfest.ro), on the last weekend of September, is Romania’s version of Oktoberfest, a beer festival in a huge marquee on Pia?a Mare."
Brasov;Romania;Europe;"With an eye for trade and invasion routes, the Saxons sited their largest settlements close to the Carpathian passes. One of the best placed, BRA?OV (Kronstadt to the Saxons and Brassó to the Hungarians) grew prosperous as a result, the economic power of its Saxon elite long outlasting its feudal privileges. During the 1960s, the communist regime drafted thousands of Moldavian villagers to Bra?ov’s new factories, making it Transylvania’s second-largest city. Economic collapse led to riots in November 1987 and December 1989; since then more factories have closed, and the city’s population has fallen by about sixty thousand, but tourism has become increasingly important.

Most visitors make a beeline for the largely Baroque Old Town, around Pia?a Sfatului, a strikingly handsome, quintessentially Germanic square dominated by the Black Church. Nearby, all coiled beneath Mount Tâmpa, are museums, medieval ramparts and the Schei quarter. The town’s proximity to a host of attractions – such as the Piatra Craiuluimountain range, the alpine resort of Poiana Bra?ov, the fortified Saxon churches of H?rman and Prejmer, and “Dracula’s Castle” at Bran – makes it an excellent base."
Arefu,_Cetatea_Poienari_and_Lacul_Vidraru;Romania;Europe;Twenty-five kilometres north of Curtea de Arge? is AREFU (or Aref), a long, ramshackle village 3km west of the valley road – if you’re travelling by car, be warned that the surface from the main road to the village is very rough. It was to here, in 1457, that the survivors of Vlad the Impaler’s massacre in Târgovi?te were marched to begin work on his castle. Although the tourist industry focuses on Bran castle in Transylvania, which has almost no connection to the Dracula myth (aside from the fact that he may have attacked it on occasion), Cetatea Poienari (Poienari Castle, aka Dracula’s Castle) was once Vlad the Impaler’s residence, and its location in the foothills of the F?g?ra? mountains makes for a wonderfully dramatic setting.
Cluj;Romania;Europe;"With its Baroque and Secession outcroppings and weathered fin-de-siècle backstreets, CLUJ (officially Cluj-Napoca; Klausenburg in German and Kolozsvár in Hungarian) looks every bit the Hungarian provincial capital it once was. The city’s focal point is Pia?a Unirii, surrounded by shops, cafés and restaurants and dominated by the monumental St Michael’s Cathedral. With a clutch of fine museums (especially the marvellous Ethnographic Museum), churches and buildings, and buzzing nightlife, Cluj could quite easily detain you for several days.

Cinema in Cluj
Cluj festivals
Eating
Unitarianism
Brief history
The city was founded by Germans in the twelfth century, on the site of a Roman Municipium, and the modern-day Magyars – now under a fifth of the city’s population – still regret its decline, fondly recalling the belle époque when Kolozsvár’s café society and literary reputation surpassed all other Balkan cities. For Romanians, however, this was the city of the Hungarian landlords until 1920; most consider Ceau?escu’s addition of Napoca to its name in 1974 as fair recognition that their Dacian forebears settled here 1850 years ago, long before the Magyars reached Transylvania. It’s rightly said that Romanians live in Cluj and Hungarians still live in Kolozsvár, with separate schools and theatres, though relations between the two communities are healthy. Cluj is also the birthplace of the Unitarian creed and its centre in Romania, further adding to the multiethnic, multi-faith cocktail.

Under communism, Cluj was industrialized and became Transylvania’s largest city, with a population of over 330,000. Nonetheless it retained something of its old languor, as well as a reputation for being anti-Ceau?escu. From 1992 to 2004, the city was run by Gheorghe Funar, the “Mad Mayor”, former leader of the Romanian National Unity Party, and notorious for his anti-Hungarianism – park benches and litter bins were painted in the colours of the Romanian flag, while several absurdly expensive monuments were raised.

Unlike almost every other Romanian city of comparable size, Cluj avoided the construction of a Civic Centre and the widespread demolition of its historic centre, which remains largely unspoiled within the line of the city walls. It’s increasingly being pedestrianized, allowing stylish new bars and restaurants to flourish; unfortunately the city’s drivers haven’t got the message and are trying to cram more and more cars into the remaining space.

Cinema in Cluj
Cluj is the unofficial capital of Romanian cinematography – it was here, in 1905, that the country’s first film studio was inaugurated, and the city has more cinemagoers than any other Romanian city. Moreover, it’s one of the few places where city-centre cinemas survive in addition to multiplexes in the new malls: notably the Cinema Florin Piersic (formerly the Republicii), Pia?a Mihai Viteazul; and Victoria, B-dul Eroilor 51. Cluj is also home to the country’s premier film festival, the Transylvanian International Film Festival (TIFF), a ten-day jamboree at the beginning of June that features a superb mix of domestic and world films shown at the cinemas listed above.

Cluj festivals
The Untold Festival (w untold.com), over the first weekend of August, is big and very popular, with dance and techno acts in the central park and the new Cluj Arena and Polyvalent Hall immediately to the west. Cluj-Napoca Days takes place in the last week of May, centred on Pia?a Unirii, along with folk/jazz/blues and theatre in Pia?a Muzeului; and the Cluj Blues Festival is held at the Ethnographic Museum in early November.

Eating
Cluj has a reasonable bunch of restaurants, including several upmarket options, various pizzerias, for instance on B-dul Eroilor, and lots of fast-food options and snack bars, especially on Str. Napoca and Pia?a Blaga. Café life in Cluj ranks second only to that of Bucharest, as does the bar and club scene, thanks to the city’s large student population.

Unitarianism
Founded in Cluj in 1556 by the hitherto Calvinist minister David Ferenc (1520–79), the Unitarian Church had its origins among the Italian and Spanish humanists and some of the more extreme Anabaptists. Unitarianism derives its name from its rejection of the doctrine of the Trinity, as well as other basic doctrines such as the divinity of Christ, his atonement for the sins of the world, and thus the possibility of salvation. However, its significance lies in its undogmatic approach – adherents are conspicuous for their devotion to liberty and reason in matters of religion and their exercise of tolerance to all sincere forms of religious faith.

By 1568 Unitarianism was already accepted as one of the four official churches of Transylvania; it spread worldwide and by the 1830s had mutated to become the religion, for instance, of the Boston/Harvard establishment, with an emphasis on scientific progress and material success. In Romania there are now around 75,000 Unitarians, almost all Hungarian-speaking."
The_Apuseni_mountains;Romania;Europe;"The Apuseni mountains lie largely between the Cri?ul Repede and the Arie? valleys, enabling easy access by public transport. The DN75 follows the Arie? west from Turda to Bihor county via Câmpeni, where the DN74 turns south to Alba, Brad and Deva. Câmpeni is the capital of the Mo?i highlanders, who repelled the Roman invaders, then moved into the hills in the eighteenth century when the Habsburgs attempted to conscript them into the army; their settlements are some of the highest in Romania, scattered groups of high-roofed, thatched cottages at up to 1400m.

The culture of the Kalotaszeg
The Measurement of the Milk Festival
Rimetea
The Girl Fair of Muntele G?ina
The Padi? plateau
Despite opposition from the forestry and other industries – although the uranium and gold mines are now closed – the Apuseni Nature Park was established in 2004, alongside the revival of an excellent network of hiking trails. The Cluj-based Johan’s Green Mountain tour operator organizes a range of activities (hiking, cycling, kayaking and horseriding) mainly in the Apuseni mountains; they can also provide information and arrange homestays throughout the Apuseni.

The culture of the Kalotaszeg
The area just west of Cluj is known to Hungarians as Kalotaszeg, and, since the great Hungarian Millennium Exhibition of 1896, they have revered it as the region where authentic Magyar culture has survived uncorrupted. It’s common to see local people selling handicrafts by the roadside – particularly to Hungarian tourists on pilgrimages to the wellsprings of their culture.

The local embroidery is particularly famous, usually consisting of stylized leaves and flowers, in one bold colour (usually bright red) on a white background; the style is known as írásos, meaning “drawn” or “written”, because the designs are marked on the cloth (traditionally with mixed milk and soot) before being stitched. The Calvinist churches are noted for their coffered ceilings, with square panels (known as “cassettes”) beautifully painted in the eighteenth century, along with the pews and galleries, in a naïf style similar to the embroidery.

The composers Béla Bartók and Zoltán Kodály collected Transylvanian crafts, and Bartók’s assortment of carved furniture from Izvoru Cri?ului (Körösfó) can be seen in his home in Budapest. Their main project, however, was to collect folk music. Starting in 1907, they managed to record and catalogue thousands of melodies, despite local suspicion of the “monster” (the apparatus for recording onto phonograph cylinders). They also discovered a rich vein of inspiration for their own compositions; Bartók declared that a genuine peasant melody was “quite as much a masterpiece in miniature as a Bach fugue or a Mozart sonata”.

The Measurement of the Milk Festival
The practice of shepherds spending summer in the high pastures protecting the flocks from bears and wolves while making cheese gave rise to Measurement of the Milk Festivals (M??urisul Laptelui), the best known of which are held in the villages around Ciucea on the slopes of M?gura Priei, the highest ridge in the Mese? range. At dawn on the first or second Sunday in May, the flocks are brought to a glade outside the village, where the “measurement” takes place. The nanny goats are milked by women and the ewes by shepherds – the yield of each family’s animals is measured to determine the share of cheese that they will receive that season. The ritual is followed by much feasting and dancing. M?gura Priei is just 10km or so north of Ciucea, and the festival is reached by buses from Huedin.

Rimetea
West of Turda, the main DN75 follows the River Arie? through a succession of small villages. A poor road leads 8km south from Buru to RIMETEA (Torockó; five buses daily from Aiud, one/two at weekends), which is famed, at least in Hungary, as one of the loveliest and most authentic of Romania’s Hungarian villages – although it was in fact inhabited by Saxons until most were killed by the Tatars. The village, prosperous due to iron mining, was rebuilt in Saxon style after a major fire in 1870, and even now furniture is painted in the Sighi?oara style. The centre of the village is now a conservation area, where almost every home has rooms to let, while big modern pensions (and two new monasteries) stand on the outskirts. Traditional dress is worn for festivals on February 22 and the first Sunday of March, and can also be seen in the Ethnographic Museum, upstairs in the Primaria, along with mining tools, locks and keys, women’s red boots and an elaborate bridal headdress.

The Girl Fair of Muntele G?ina
The Girl Fair (Târgul de Fete) of Muntele G?ina takes place on the closest Sunday to July 20 on the flat top of Mount G?ina (Hen Mountain), roughly 33km west of Câmpeni, near the village of Avram Iancu, named after the leader of the 1848 revolt against the Hungarians who was born here in 1824. The region’s largest festival, it was originally a means for young men who were away shepherding for two-thirds of the year to meet young women from other communities and to pursue matrimony. Prospective spouses made every effort to enhance their appeal, the girls being displayed in their finest attire, surrounded by linen, pottery and other dowry items – even carting along rented furniture. This aspect of the fair has all but disappeared, but thousands still come for the music and spectacle.

Buses bring visitors from Câmpeni to the fair, which is a large and lively event, but the real action is on the hill top, and you should really camp there the night before to catch the dawn chorus on tulnics (alphorns). A rough forestry road takes an 8km loop to reach the hill top, but you can find more direct routes on foot. The biggest names in popular traditional Romanian music appear here, with local dance ensembles, and there’s plenty of food and drink, but little drunkenness.

The Padi? plateau
The Padi? plateau (Plateul Padi?) is at the heart of a classic karst area, with streams vanishing underground and reappearing unexpectedly, and dips and hollows everywhere, all promising access to the huge cave and river systems that lie beneath. The road from Sudrigiu (to the west in Bihor county) has now been paved, and the north–south route between Huedin and Albac via Padi? and Horea is largely paved; the plateau is at risk of uncontrolled development but there is still plenty of enjoyable hiking here on easy woodland trails that drop suddenly into gigantic sinkholes."
Iasi;Romania;Europe;"IA?I (pronounced “yash”), in the northeast of Moldavia, is the region’s cultural capital and by far its most attractive city, the only one where you’re likely to want to stay a while. Its university, theatre and resident orchestra rival those of Bucharest – which was merely a crude market town when Ia?i became a princely seat – and give it an air of sophistication enhanced by a large contingent of foreign students. Cementing its place in the nation’s heart, Romanians associate Ia?i with the poet Eminescu, and Moldavians also esteem it as the burial place of St Paraschiva.

The majority of Ia?i’s sights are strung along a north–south axis through the city, with the anonymous main square, Pia?a Unirii, joining the two halves. To the north of the square, beyond the excellent Museum of the Union, lie the university district of Copou, home to the enlightening University Museum as well as parks and gardens, and the residential district of ?ic?u, location for a couple of memorial houses. South of the square, Ia?i’s traditional interplay of civil and religious authority is symbolized by a parade of edifices along Bulevardul ?tefan cel Mare ?i Sfânt, where florid public buildings face grandiose churches, not least the magnificent Church of the Three Hierarchs. This in turn leads down to the huge Palace of Culture, housing several museums, though these are currently closed as part of a long-term restoration programme. Beyond here is the Nicolina quarter, where you’ll find a trio of fabulous hilltop monasteries.

Brief history
Ia?i’s ascendancy dates from the sixteenth century, when the Moldavian princes (hospodars) gave up the practice of maintaining courts in several towns, and settled permanently in Ia?i. This coincided with Moldavia’s gradual decline into a Turkish satellite, ruled by despots who endowed Ia?i with churches and monasteries to trumpet their earthly glory and ensure their eternal salvation. Basil the Wolf (Vasile Lupu, 1634–53) promulgated a penal code whereby rapists were raped and arsonists burned alive; he also founded a printing press and school, which led to the flowering of Moldavian literature during the brief reign, from 1710–11, of the enlightened Dimitrie Cantemir.

After Cantemir’s death, Moldavia fell under the control of Greek Phanariots, originally from the Phanar district of Constantinople (Fener in modern Istanbul), who administered the region on behalf of the Ottoman Empire, chose and deposed the nominally ruling princes (of whom there were 36 between 1711 and 1821), and eventually usurped the throne for themselves. The boyars adopted Turkish dress and competed to win the favour of the Phanariots, the sole group that advised the sultan whom among the boyars he should promote.

As Ottoman power weakened, this dismal saga was interrupted by the surprise election of Prince Alexandru Ioan Cuza, who clinched the unification of Moldavia and Wallachia in 1859 with the diplomatic support of France. In the new Romania, Cuza founded universities at Ia?i and Bucharest, introduced compulsory schooling for both sexes, and secularized monastic property, which at the time accounted for one-fifth of Moldavia. Finally, his emancipation of the serfs so enraged landowners and military circles that in 1866 they overthrew Cuza and restored the status quo ante – but kept the union.

The latter half of the nineteenth century was a fertile time for intellectual life in Ia?i, where the Junimea literary circle attracted such talents as the poet Mihai Eminescu and the writer Ion Creang?, who, like the historian Nicolae Iorga, became national figures. This was also the heyday of Jewish culture in Ia?i (or Jassy, as it was called in Yiddish), and in 1876 local impresario Avrom Goldfadn staged the world’s first Yiddish theatre performance at the Pumul Verde (“Green Tree”) wine garden, facing the present National Theatre. The Junimea brand of nationalism was more romantic than chauvinist, but unwittingly paved the way for a deadlier version in the Greater Romania that was created to reward the Old Kingdom (Regat) for its sacrifices in World War I, when most of the country was occupied by the Germans, and the government was evacuated to Ia?i. With its borders enlarged to include Bessarabia and Bucovina, Moldavia inherited large minorities of Jews, Ukrainians and Gypsies, aggravating ethnic and class tensions in a region devastated by war.

During the 1920s, Ia?i became notorious for anti-Semitism, spearheaded by a professor whose League of Christian National Defence virtually closed the university to Jews, then over a third of the population, and later spawned the Iron Guard. Their chief scapegoat was Magda Lupescu, Carol II’s locally born Jewish mistress, widely hated for amassing a fortune by shady speculations; in 1940 she fled abroad with Carol in a train stuffed with loot."
