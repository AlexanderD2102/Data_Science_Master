Kuopio’s woodsmoke sauna (Tues year-round, plus Thurs June–Aug; €12) is the main draw in town, and about as quintessentially Finnish an experience as you’ll find: there are traditional Finnish evenings each night the sauna is open, which include a Lumberjack Show and great dinner buffet from mid-May to mid-August (€21). The sauna is located 4km south of the centre within the Rauhalahti spa hotel complex.
