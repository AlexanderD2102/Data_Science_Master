A few blocks north of the Rynek on ul. Pijarska sits the Czartoryski Palace, usually home to Kraków’s finest art collection, although it is closed until 2014 for renovation. When it reopens, highlights will include Rembrandt’s brooding Landscape with Merciful Samaritan and Leonardo da Vinci’s Lady with an Ermine.
