About a third of Finland is covered by the Lake Region, a massive area of bays, inlets and isles interspersed with dense pine forests. Despite holding much of Finland’s industry, it’s a remote, peaceful, verdant area, and even Tampere, a major industrial city, enjoys a laidback lakeside setting. The eastern part of the region is the most atmospheric: slender ridges furred with conifers link the few sizeable landmasses. The regional centre, Savonlinna, stretches gorgeously across several islands and boasts a fine medieval castle, inside which a famous opera festival is held every summer, while bustling Kuopio has superb museums and another enviable lakeshore location for water-based fun.
