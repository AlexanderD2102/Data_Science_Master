It’s hard to overstate the impact of the Lauterbrunnen valley. An immense U-shaped cleft with bluffs on either side rising 1000m sheer, doused by some 72 waterfalls, it is utterly spectacular. The Staubbach falls – Switzerland’s highest at nearly 300m – tumble just beyond the village of Lauterbrunnen at the valley entrance, whose station (served by trains from Interlaken Ost) is opposite both the cable-car station for Mürren and the tourist office. From Lauterbrunnen, it’s a scenic half-hour walk, or an hourly postbus, 3km up the valley to the spectacular Trümmelbach falls, a series of thunderous waterfalls – fed by the glaciers above – which have carved corkscrew channels inside the valley walls. The bus continues 1.5km to the end of the road at Stechelberg; the cable-car station for Gimmelwald, Mürren and the Schilthorn is 1km before the hamlet.
