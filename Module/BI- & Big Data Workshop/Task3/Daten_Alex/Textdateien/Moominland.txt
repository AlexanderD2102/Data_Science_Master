15km west of Turku, the small town of Naantali is one of the biggest and best-preserved examples of Finnish wooden architecture, and the gateway to a chunk of the archipelago lying off the southwest coast (much accessible by road). There are several good-quality restaurants here, though the big attraction is Moominland (daily mid-June to Aug; day ticket €28) theme park, devoted to the famous Finnish children’s book characters. Needless to say, kids enjoy this most. Buses #6/7 from Turku’s kauppatori (market square) run here.
