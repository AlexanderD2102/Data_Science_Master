The islands lying off the Finnish coast run into the thousands, of which Vallisaari – until 2016 private military property – is the latest to become easily accessible. It’s an island for wildlife lovers, as the flora here is superb, and marked trails criss-cross it. Bring a picnic. The ferry (May–Aug daily hourly; Sept Sat & Sun hourly; €7.50 return) stops at Suomenlinna on the return, so you can explore both.
